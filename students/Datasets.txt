1. For the "General Brain" (Logic Core)
Dataset: Kaggle: Engine Fault Detection Data

Required Columns: Engine Speed, Lubrication oil pressure, Coolant temperature, Engine Vibration.

Usage: Train a Random Forest Classifier.

Input: [RPM, Pressure, Temp, Vib]

Output: [0=Normal, 1=Fault]

Goal: This teaches your agent the "General Rules" of engines (e.g., "High Temp usually means Fault").

2. For the "Vibration/Structural" Module
Dataset: Kaggle: NASA Bearing Dataset

Required Columns: Bearing 1, Bearing 2 (Accelerometer data).

Usage: Train an Anomaly Detector (Isolation Forest).

Goal: To learn what "Good" vibration looks like vs. "Bad" vibration (inner race faults). You will map the output of this model to your simulated Vib variable.

3. For the "Hydraulic/Oil" Module
Dataset: Kaggle: Hydraulic Systems Condition Monitoring

Required Columns: PS1 (System Pressure), FS1 (Volume Flow).

Usage: Train a Regression Model.

Goal: To predict what the oil pressure should be at a given RPM. If the actual simulated pressure is lower than this prediction, your AI raises a "Leak Suspected" alert.
